# Tech Support Simplifier
A very badly made app that is really only designed so I can speed up my workflow when helping people with tech support stuff please don't judge me for the terrible things that exist within it kthx


It does some stuff, but I'm not gonna be responsible if you just press buttons and it all breaks. This can probably kinda really mess up your Windows installation so plz don't expect it to just be awesome and not break everything
